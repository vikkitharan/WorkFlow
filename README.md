    2. **develop** is most updated branch and it is ready for *next release*.
    3. **realease\_x.0 or release\_x.y.0** is the release branch. Block point release branch and minor release branches take \_x\_0 \_x.y.0 labels (here x is the current major version and  y is the minor version)
    4. **feature** branch contains the commits for a new feature.
    5. **hotfix \_x.y or hotfix\_x.y.z** is the branch to fix issue on **master** branch.
